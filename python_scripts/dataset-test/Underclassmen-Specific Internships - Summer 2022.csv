Activision (Specific ones will come out),Fresh/Soph,SWE,,,Rolling,Open,Open,,,"For too long, underclassmen in CS, DS, CompE, and related fields have taken to Reddit to ask the same question time and time again-- What internships and oppurtunities are there specifically for underclassmen? Through this spreadsheet I hope to not only clear up r/CSMajors, but also to encourage students to get a head start in their professional search early on.

Please feel free to make make comments in regards to new additions, updated links, missing info, etc. I'll try to be active and review comments ASAP.

This sheet is for underclassmen specific internships and companies that historically accept a larger amount of freshmen than expected from your average tech company. The positions that the internships are for can vary slightly so long as the general area is a job that an ECE major or a CS major could typically take up. Anything that has ""developmental program"" is not an official internship, but it is an oppurtunity which lasts a minimum of 2 weeks in which you will gain technical and professional experience. Keeping this in mind, if you are an underclassman who is accessing this spreadsheet, it is highly encouraged that you apply to every single internship you can and that you find interesting regardless of what the preferred class standing, or lack thereof, may be. If you're really driven and want an internship, then take advantage of every single application that you can to find one that sticks. Additionally, try to take advantage of your school's career opportunities center for resume review and interview prep. Lastly, know that if you do not end up landing an internship as an underclassman, it's okay. Internships are not the end-all, and whether you are or are not selected for an internship does not delegate self-worth.

Good luck to you all!   (PS: If anyone wants to convert this into a GitHub as one of their projects, please, feel free to do so. I would, but unfortunately I don't have the time; I had most of this as a result of my internship search for this season. Check out Sheets API if you're interested.)"
